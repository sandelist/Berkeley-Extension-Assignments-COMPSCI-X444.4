Module 5 Assignment
Instructions
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion (40 points)

Create a Python 3 program that asks the user to input a temperature in Celsius and then outputs that temperature in Fahrenheit. Submit the .py file for your program.
Testing

Your program should work for any temperature that is input. I will test your program using one of more of the following values: 33, -5, 3.4

Your program should produce the following output (with values accurate to to two or more decimal places) for each of these input values:

33.0 Celsius equals 91.4 Fahrenheit
-5.0 Celsius equals 23.0 Fahrenheit
3.4 Celsius equals 38.12 Fahrenheit
2. Centimeters to Inches Conversion (40 points)

Create a Python 3 program that asks the user to input a value in centimeters and then outputs that value in inches. 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. Submit the .py file for your program.
Testing

Your program should work for any legitimate value that is input. I will test your program using one of more of the following value: 2, 5.08

Your program should produce the following output (with values accurate to two or more decimal places) for each of these input values:

2 Centimeters equals 0.79 Inches
5.08 Centimeters equals 2.0 Inches

 
3. All about Circles (20 points)

Create a Python 3 program that asks the user to input the radius of a circle in inches. The program should then output the the following based on the user's input radius and where your program calculates the [value] based on the appropriate formula:

- The radius of your circle is [value] inches
- The circumference of your circle [value] inches
- The area of your circle is [value] square inches
- A sphere with the radius of your circle would be have a surface area of [value] square inches and a volume of [value] cubic inches.

In your calculations you can use 3.14 as the value of Pi.

Submit the .py file for your program.
Testing

Your program should work for any legitmate radius value that is input. I will test your program using a radius of 6 inches.

Your program should produce the following output the following results for this input:

- The radius of your circle is 6 inches
- The circumference of your circle 37.68 inches
- The area of your circle is 113.04 square inches
- A sphere with the radius of your circle would be have a surface area 452.16 square inches and a volume of 904.32 cubic inches. 
Grading

Your code will be graded based on the following criteria:

    Produces the correct results: 50%
    Efficiency of code - the fewer lines of code the better: 25%
    Maintainability - your code should be well commented and should be easy to maintain and update: 25%

- You must use Python 3 for all programming assignments.
- You can resubmit your code once for re-grading.
- A programs that won't run or which produces a syntax error will receive a score of zero. You can still re-submit your code but you will lose 20 points.
- If your program does not produce the correct results for the test input values that are given in the question or if you have clearly ignored the instructions you may re-submit but will lose 10 points.
- You may not "pre-submit" your code and ask for feedback.
